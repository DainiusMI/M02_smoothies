# SMOOTHIES
This project is a part of an early html/css course introducing CSS flex. This time I am going in without completing the video course, using only a link provided by a tutor to a flexbox guide and his already completed design. (Images used in this project have been downloaded from his repository)

## LINK TO MY DESIGN WEB VERSION:
https://dainiusmi.github.io/M02_smoothies/
## LINK TO HIS DESIGN REFERENCE:
https://front-end-by-rimantas.github.io/32-grupe-smoothies/

## INITIAL GOALS:
- test myself on what I have learned so far
- learn about Flexbox and use it as a main element alignment tool in this project
- implement responsive design to the best of my current abilities
- uppon completing this project as far as I can on my own compare the difference and list them.

## CONCLUSION:
- my responsive design uses "width = viewport %" to scale content instead of using fixed size as his does.
- my responsive design does not fearture a collapsing navigation bar uppon reaching mobile version resolution (it seems it was done using JS, I will have to look into that  - COMPLETED)
